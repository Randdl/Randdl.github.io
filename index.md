## Research Interest

I'm interested in machine learning, computer vision, social computing, and social media analysis. I work in [Dr. Dan Work](https://lab-work.github.io/) and [Dr. Meiyi Ma](https://meiyima.github.io/)'s lab.
I'm currently working on polygon IoU loss for 3D vehicle detection. I designed an efficient Iou loss function of irregular polygons. Part of the project can be viewed in this repository: [github.com/Randdl/polygon_iou_loss](https://github.com/Randdl/polygon_iou_loss).
I'm also working on detecting logical conflicts between city specifications with NLP and rule-based systems. A presentation of the current work can be found here: [Conflict Detection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SAYvYsSE4EwwFmQNRNmeudqlkH5WN61o/view?usp=share_link).
